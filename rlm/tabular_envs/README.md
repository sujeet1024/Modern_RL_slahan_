# Tabular Environments

This sections contains simple grid based environments for understanding (classic, basic) Good Old Fashioned RL (GOFRL)

Most of these environments are inspired from RL book by Prof Rich Sutton and Prof Barto, and adapted from assignments of RL specialization by amii. These environments follow gym's environment structure for ease of use and consistency.

These aren't tabular but continuous, hence, shouldn't be included here
Gymnasium environments used for this setting:
    Mountain Car (discrete)
    Pendulum Swing
